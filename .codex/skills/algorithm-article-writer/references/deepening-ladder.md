# Deepening Ladder (PDKH)

Purpose: deepen understanding by drilling into 1-2 core concepts instead of adding parallel topics. Each step must reference the same concept.

## Lineage (Master Influences)
- George Pólya: problem framing and example-first reasoning ("How to Solve It").
- Edsger Dijkstra + C.A.R. Hoare: invariants, correctness, and proof discipline.
- Donald Knuth: formalization, complexity, and implementation realities.
- Jon Bentley + Robert Sedgewick: counterexamples, pitfalls, and empirical tradeoffs.

## PDKH Steps (Apply to each chosen concept)
1. Problem Reframe (Pólya)
   - Restate the concept in one sentence tied to the article's goal.
2. Minimal Worked Example (Bentley)
   - Use the smallest non-trivial numeric example and walk 2-3 steps.
3. Invariant or Contract (Dijkstra/Hoare)
   - State the invariant or pre/post condition precisely.
4. Formalization (Knuth)
   - Provide formula, state transition, or structured algorithm steps.
5. Correctness Sketch (Dijkstra/Hoare)
   - Explain preservation + termination or why it is correct.
6. Thresholds and Complexity (Knuth)
   - Give a scale or regime where the concept dominates.
7. Counterexample or Failure Mode (Bentley/Sedgewick)
   - Provide a failure case and its implications.
8. Engineering Reality (Knuth)
   - Include constant factors, memory access, or implementation caveats.

## Guardrail
- Do not add new top-level topics to meet length. Only deepen the chosen concepts.

## Evidence Note
- Name the 1-2 concepts you deepened and list which steps you completed.
