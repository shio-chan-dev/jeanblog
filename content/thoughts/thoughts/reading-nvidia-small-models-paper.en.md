# What problem does this paper solve, and what are the results?

We know AI systems are expanding and can solve general tasks. But many AI agent applications today target small tasks. NVIDIA argues that small language models (SLMs) are capable, more suitable, and cheaper, and should be a main direction for future agents.

The paper discusses:
1. What tasks current SLMs can handle
2. Where general language ability matters
3. The limits of SLMs as agents

Conclusion: moving from LLMs to SLMs has advantages in both capability and cost.
