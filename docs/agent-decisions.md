# Agent Decisions

- Date: 2026-01-25
  Decision: Create new skill `algorithm-article-writer` for long-form algorithm explanations with runnable code.
  Rationale: Existing `leetcode-acers-blogger` is specialized for LeetCode; algorithm concept posts need a different structure and language selection rules.
  Scope: `.codex/skills/algorithm-article-writer/` with template, acceptance criteria, and reinforcement scaffolding.
